      - Transcribe: A web app that provides fast and accurate audio transcription through open-source and enterprise-level models, including the OpenAI Whisper model and Google Gemini models.
      - Ask Oscar (currently under construction): An AI assistant that can answer questions based on documentation of CCV and other Brown services.
