    CCV AI Tools provides a set of generative AI tools that are built and deployed in-house at Brown for all members of the Brown community. These tools include:
    - **LibreChat** (under construction): A chat interface that lets you talk to multiple AI models in a private, customizable way
    - **Transcribe**: Transcribe audio files in over 20 different languages to text using state-of-the-art AI models such as Google Gemini and OpenAI Whisper.
    - **Ask Oscar** (under construction): An AI assistant that can answer questions based on documentation of CCV and other Brown services.

    IceFloeTracker.jl is an open-source Julia package for tracking Arctic Ocean ice floes using data from the Aqua 
    and Terra Earth-observation satellites. It detects floe trajectories and rotation rates to infer ocean currents 
    and eddies, providing datasets that validate and inform ocean models within broader climate research. A built-in 
    workflow manager scales analyses from regional studies to the entire Arctic over decade-long timescales.

  categories: ["3D Visualization", "Image Processing", "Neuroscience"]
  description: |
    This project implements a comprehensive pipeline and application designed to assist researchers in identifying, labeling, and counting cells in mouse brain scans. Utilizing pre-trained deep learning models, the system analyzes 3D image data to automatically segment cells and generate structured results. This automated approach significantly reduces manual effort, accelerates research workflows, and improves consistency by minimizing human bias in segmentation and labeling processes, enabling neuroscience researchers to focus on analysis and interpretation rather than time-intensive manual cell identification.
